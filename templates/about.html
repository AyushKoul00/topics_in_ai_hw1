    <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4">
      Welcome! I'm <strong>Ayush Koul</strong>, a passionate computer scientist specializing in distributed systems, AI,
      and scalable solutions. My journey in technology began with a fascination for how things work and a desire to
      create impactful solutions.

      I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at San Jose State University, expecting to graduate
      in 2025. I have a solid academic foundation, having earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Graphic
      Era University, where I gained experience in a wide range of programming languages, including Python, C++, and
      Java, as well as cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Throughout my studies, Iâ€™ve developed a strong
      technical skill set in frameworks and tools such as React.js, Node.js, and Docker. Additionally, I hold
      certifications in Microsoft AZ-900 and DP-900, which have deepened my understanding of cloud computing.

      In terms of professional experience, I currently work as a Graduate Research Assistant at San Jose State
      University, where I focus on optimizing weather models using GPU programming, significantly boosting their
      performance. My previous internship at Johnson & Johnson (Medtech) allowed me to implement key optimizations for
      their Python monorepos, improving build performance. I also gained valuable experience as a Software Engineer at
      Samsung Research, where I developed XR tools and services that improved system efficiency and were adopted by
      multiple departments.
